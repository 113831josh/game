        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Joshua Casillas, and I am a 15 year old boy who is a sophomore at ESUMS. This website is meant to document and show my progress throughout the game
           we are making in our multimedia and tech design class. I think I want my game to be some kind of 2D platformer, a game where the players moves throughout the level
            using some kind of gimmick with a special keybind
    <h3>My Own Definition of Game</h3>
      My definition of game is; a digital or physical form of entertainment played with a ruleset.
         <h3>My Own Gamer Types</h3>
             60% Killer
             47% Achiever
             27% Socialiser
             <h3>My Fav Games</h3>
             My top two favorite games are Persona 5 and the God of War franchise. Persona 5 is up there because the story, gameplay, and music. The entire God of War franchise
             is up here because of the twist the creators put on the greek mythology and pantheon.
